Description: Coding exercise of PacMan going from left to right on screen (with page width serving as movement borders).
Installation: 
- Download all images, index.html, and pacman.js files.
- Modify index.html source based on stored images repository.
Usage: The expected outcome of the combined files is to show PacMan moving on the screen from left to right while opening and closing its mouth. When it reaches each bound, PacMan will reverse its direction accordingly.
Roadmap: Future improvements are to change PacMan's direction for vertical movement.
